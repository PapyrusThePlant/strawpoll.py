Is this project dead?
=====================

No, it is not dead, I am still around, there just isn't much to do until either Strawpoll update
their api or someone stumbles upon this package and finds an issue with it.

Installation
============

::

    $ pip install strawpoll.py

Usage
=====

.. code :: py

    import asyncio
    import strawpoll

    async def main():
        api = strawpoll.API()

        p1 = await api.get_poll(10915632)
        print(p1.results())

        p2 = strawpoll.Poll('lol?', ['ha', 'haha', 'hahaha', 'hahahaha', 'hahahahaha'])
